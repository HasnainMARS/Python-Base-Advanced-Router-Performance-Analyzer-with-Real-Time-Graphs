## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and diagnostic purposes only**.
Do **NOT** use it on networks, routers, or devices you do not own or lack explicit permission to test.
Unauthorized testing may be illegal and disruptive.

## ✨ Features

* 🌐 HTTP request testing across common router endpoints
* 🔌 Telnet (port 23) connection attempts
* 📡 ICMP ping requests
* 📊 Real-time system monitoring with `matplotlib`:

  * CPU usage
  * Memory usage
  * Network throughput (sent/received)
  * Requests per second
* 📈 Detailed performance report at the end of each test

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HasnainMARS/Python-Base-Advanced-Router-Performance-Analyzer-with-Real-Time-Graphs.git
cd Python-Base-Advanced-Router-Performance-Analyzer-with-Real-Time-Graphs
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
conda create -n router-test python=3.10
conda activate router-test
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or manually:

```bash
pip install requests psutil matplotlib
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Edit the target IP address in `main()` of `advanced_router_analyzer.py`:

```python
target_ip = "192.168.1.1"  # replace with your router IP
```

Run the analyzer:

```bash
python advanced_router_analyzer.py
```

✅ While the test runs:

* A live **graph window** will show resource usage and request rates.
* The terminal will display real-time stats.
* A final performance report will print at the end.

## 💡 Educational Insights

* Real-time graphs visualize **system resource usage** during load.
* CPU spikes = processing load on your computer.
* Memory usage shows script footprint.
* Network graphs illustrate request/response patterns.
* Final report helps understand router resilience under stress.
